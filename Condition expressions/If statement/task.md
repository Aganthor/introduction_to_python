## If statement

Compound statements in Python contain (groups of) other statements; they affect or control 
the execution of those other statements in some way. The `if`, `while` and `for` statements
implement traditional control flow constructs.

Perhaps the most well-known statement type is the if statement. The `if` keyword is 
used to form a conditional statement that executes some 
specified code after checking if its expression is `True`. Python uses indentation 
to define code blocks.  

If you have only one statement to execute, you can put it on the same line as the if statement.

```python
if a > b: print("a is greater than b")
```

Print `"empty"` if the `tasks` list is empty.  

<div class='hint'>Use the <code>len()</code> function to check if <code>tasks</code> is empty.</div>
