## Boolean operators order

Boolean operators are not evaluated from left to right. There's an order of operations for boolean operators: `not` is evaluated first, `and` is evaluated next, `or` is evaluated last.  
  
Check if `name` is `"Ellis"` or if it's not true that `name` is `"John"` and he is `17` years old at the same time.  

<div class='hint'>Combine <code>is</code>, <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, <code>not</code> and <code>==</code> operators.</div>

<div class='hint'>Use brackets to combine operations you need to be evaluated first, just like in math equations.</div>
