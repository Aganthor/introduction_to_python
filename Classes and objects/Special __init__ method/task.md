## Special &#95;&#95;init&#95;&#95; method

`__init__` is one of the reserved methods in Python. It is used to initialize objects it 
creates: `__init__` is short for "initialize". 

If defined, the `__init__()` function is called when an object of the class is created, 
it initializes the object and its attributes. It always takes at least 
one argument, `self`, which refers to the object itself.


Add parameters to the `Car` class `__init__()` method, so we can create it with a specific color.  

<div class='hint'>Add two parameters &mdash; <code>self</code> and <code>color</code>.</div>
