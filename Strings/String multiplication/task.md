## String multiplication

Python also supports string-by-number multiplication (but not the other way around!).  
  
Use `hello` to get a duplicated `"hellohello"` 
string ( `"hello"` repeated `2` times). There is an error in the solution at the moment. 

<div class='hint'>Use multiplication and mind its order.</div>
