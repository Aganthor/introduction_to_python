## Boolean operators

Boolean is a type of value that can only be `True` or `False` . The `==` (equality) operator checks whether the two variables being compared are equal.  

Other comparison operators:
- `!=` not equal;
- `<` less than;
- `>` greater than;
- `<=` less than or equal to;
- `>=` greater than or equal to.
  
Check whether the variable `two` is equal to `three` .
