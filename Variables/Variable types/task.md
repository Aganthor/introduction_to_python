## Variable types

In Python, there are two main types of numbers: integers and floats. The most important 
difference between them is that a `float` is a number that has a decimal point, 
and an `int` is a number without a decimal point.  
  
Determine the type of the variable `float_number`.

Check out how we determined the type of <code>number</code> on line 2 and do the same with <code>float_number</code>.</div>
