## Arithmetic operators

Just as with any other programming language, the addition ( `+` ), subtraction ( `-` ), 
multiplication ( `*` ), and division ( `/` ) operators can be used with numbers. In 
addition, Python has the power ( `**` ) and modulo ( `%` ) operators.  
  
Divide the value stored in `number` by `2` and then calculate the remainder.  

<div class='hint'>First, use the <code>/</code> operator.</div>
<div class='hint'>Then use the <code>%</code> operator.</div>
