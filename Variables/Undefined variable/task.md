## Undefined variable

Variable names may only contain Latin letters, digits, and/or the underscore 
character, and they cannot start with a digit. They also cannot be any of the 
reserved <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords">keywords</a>.
### Task
Check what happens if you use a variable which is not defined yet. Change and run the code in the editor â€“ try to print out an **undefined** name (i.e. type the name of an undefined variable inside the brackets of the `print` statement).  
This should cause an exception - a `NameError`.

Note, that "check" command only runs the testing system, and you will not see the output, so you need to run the file.

<div class="hint">for example, try to print <code>var1</code> variable instead of <code>variable</code></div>
