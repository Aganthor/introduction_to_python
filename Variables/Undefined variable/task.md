## Undefined variable

Variable names may only contain latin letters, digits, and/or the underscore character, and they cannot start with a digit.  
  
Check what happens if you use a variable which is not defined yet. Try to print out an undefined name.  

<div class="hint">Type the name of an undefined variable inside the brackets of the <code>print</code> statement. 
Note that variable names must start with a letter and can contain only letters, '_' and numbers.</div>
