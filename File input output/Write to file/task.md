## Write to file

If you open a file using `"w"` (write) as the second argument, a new empty file will be created. Note that if another file with the same name exists, it will be deleted. If you want to add some content to an existing file, you should use the `"a"` (append) modifier.  
  
Add elements from the `zoo` list to "output.txt".  

<div class='hint'>Use the <code>a</code> modifier to append lines at the end of the file.</div>
<div class="hint">Check out the section 7.2.1 "Methods of File Objects" in this <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html">Python Tutorial chapter</a> 
and find a method that writes into a file.</div>
<div class='hint'>Use the <code>write()</code> method.</div>
<div class='hint'>Don't forget to call the <code>close()</code> method.</div>
