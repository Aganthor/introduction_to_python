## Our first program

Traditionally the first program you write in any programming language is `"Hello World!"`.  
  
Introduce yourself to the World.  
  
To run this script, right-click anywhere in the **Editor** view so you can see the context menu and select **Run 'hello_world'**.   
Alternatively, you can use the &shortcut:RunClass; shortcut.
Exclusively in PyCharm Edu, you can use the ![](execute.svg) gutter icon.
