## Our first program

Traditionally the first program you write in any programming language is `"Hello World!"`.  
  
Introduce yourself to the World.  
  
To run a script, right-click anywhere in the **Editor** view so you can see the context menu and select **Run &lt;script_name&gt;**.   
Alternatively, you can use the &shortcut:RunClass; shortcut.

If this task was not clear enough or you want more theory, we would suggest trying projects on [JetBrains Academy](https://hi.hyperskill.org/).
You can select one of the Python projects there and build it [right in the IDE](
https://hyperskill.org/plugin#python.).

To enable Python support, log in to your profile on JetBrains Academy, and then go to **Settings | Learning Goal | Python Developer**.
