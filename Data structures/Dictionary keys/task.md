## Dictionary keys

Try to figure out what's wrong with this dictionary and fix it.

When fixing, be aware of the following requirements
- Since the dictionary keys can be only immutable types, replace the list with several individual `key:value` pairs with keys of type `str` or with a tuple.
- Since the keys need to be unique, rename one of the 'Bob' keys to any name you want.
