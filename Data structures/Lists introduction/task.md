## Lists introduction

A list is a data structure you can use to store a collection of different pieces of 
information under a single variable name. A list can be written as an array of 
comma-separated values (items) inside square brackets, e.g. `lst = [item1, item2]`. 
Lists might contain items of different types, but usually all the items in a list 
are of the same type. Like strings, lists can be indexed and sliced (see [Lesson 3](#lesson3#task3#)).  
  
Use list slicing to print `[4, 9, 16]` .  

<div class='hint'>List slicing syntax looks just like that for strings: <code>lst[index1:index2]</code>.
Don't forget that element with index <code>index2</code> is not included!</div>
