## List items

Assignment is possible to slices of lists, just like to individual list elements. 
This way you can even change the size of a list or clear it entirely by doing something like:

```python
animals[:] = []
```
  
Make all `animals` elephants by replacing the last two items.  
We suggest that you first run the program in the IDE without changes to see how the `animals` list looks like after all the operations have been made
