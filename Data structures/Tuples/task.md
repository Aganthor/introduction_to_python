## Tuples

Tuples are almost identical to lists. The only significant difference between tuples and 
lists is that tuples are immutable: you cannot add, replace, or delete elements from 
a tuple. Tuples are constructed by comma-separated elements enclosed in parentheses, for 
example `(a, b, c)` . A single-item tuple must have a trailing comma, such as `(d,)`.  

Some list methods (the ones that don't change the sequence) are also 
applicable to tuples. You can read more about tuples <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#tuples-and-sequences">here</a>.
